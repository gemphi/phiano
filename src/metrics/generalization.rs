//! Generalization: local (in-distribution) versus extreme (unfamiliar) material.
//!
//! The previous implementation selected test words by *phase distance* from the
//! training words, then scored template sentences by *phase coherence* — the
//! selection criterion and the measurement were the same quantity, so the
//! result was close to circular, and both halves were driven by the collapse
//! dynamic rather than by anything about generalization.
//!
//! Here the split is by **vocabulary coverage** (how much of a sentence the
//! model has ever seen) and the measurement is **held-out perplexity** — two
//! different quantities, neither of which can be improved by synchronising the
//! lexicon.
