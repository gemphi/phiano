//! Topology of the color-space-time manifold — abstract shapes for
//! linguistic building blocks.
//!
//! Words, phrases, sentences, stories, and concepts are not just points
//! on the manifold — they have **shape**. This module defines the
//! topological structures that emerge when linguistic units are mapped
//! onto the color-space-time manifold as graphs.
//!
//! # Building Blocks
//!
//! ```text
//!   Word       → Vertex (0-simplex)     — a single manifold point
//!   Phrase     → Edge (1-simplex)       — two words + their coupling
//!   Sentence   → Path (1-chain)         — ordered sequence of edges
//!   Story      → Surface (2-complex)    — network of connected sentences
//!   Concept    → Manifold region        — attractor basin of related words
//! ```
//!
//! Each shape is evaluated without data concreteness — we understand
//! the building blocks through their geometric relationships on the
//! manifold, not through specific word content.
