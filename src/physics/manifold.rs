//! color-space-time manifold — the geometric space where words live.
//!
//! Words are mapped onto a continuous manifold that unifies color
//! (wavelength) and time (frequency). The manifold is a torus T²
//! parameterized by (phase, band_n×α), where the fine-structure
//! constant α provides the quantum sub-band spacing.
//!
//! The manifold supports:
//! - **Geodesic distance**: shortest path between two words in color-space-time
//! - **Gradient flow**: direction of steepest semantic change
//! - **Standing wave nodes**: stable equilibrium positions (word meanings)
