/// Gemgum — Golden-ratio Elastic Matrix: GUm for word Mapping.
///
/// The binding layer that couples the phiton/chiton light architecture
/// to the linguistic word model. Gemgum uses the golden ratio φ to
/// create a natural, self-organizing mapping between:
///
/// - **Phase angles** (the existing facet model)
/// - **Color wavelengths** (phiton's spectral domain)
/// - **Temporal frequencies** (chiton's wave domain)
/// - **Word meanings** (the lexicon)
///
/// # How It Works
///
/// The golden ratio φ ≈ 1.618 provides the optimal distribution of
/// semantic points across the color-space-time manifold. Gemgum acts as
/// the "gum" that binds words to their physically-derived positions:
///
/// 1. A word's `SpectralPhasor` (phase, amplitude, band_n) is mapped
///    through phical to a `ColorSpaceTimePoint` on the manifold.
/// 2. The golden ratio determines the word's natural position within
///    its spectral band (sub-band distribution).
/// 3. Gemgum computes the binding strength between a word and its
///    manifold position, which determines how "settled" the word is.
///
/// This is where "natural linguistic functions and word mapping make
/// intelligence plausible" — words follow the physics of light.
