//! Persistent correction journal.
//!
//! A correction is the one thing this architecture does that a gradient-trained
//! model cannot: unlearn a specific association in microseconds without
//! disturbing anything else. That advantage is worth very little if the
//! correction evaporates the next time the model is rebuilt from source.
//!
//! `correct_mistake` previously returned `()` and left no record, so a
//! user-taught fix could not be replayed after a re-ingest, audited, or undone.
//! This journal makes teaching durable.
