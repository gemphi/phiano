/// CompositionTuner - the "Monitor" in the Flower-Hayes model.
///
/// The monitor orchestrates the recursive writing process:
///
///   1. PROPOSE: Generate 64 sector variations (flow.rs)
///   2. EVALUATE: Score each variation (better.rs)
///   3. DISCARD + TRAIN: Keep the better, discard the worse,
///      train on the better (worse.rs + Kuramoto)
///   4. RECURSE: Generate again with the re-tuned facet
///   5. CONVERGE: Stop when the top score stops improving
///
/// This is how a child learns to write:
/// - The teacher gives a prompt and examples
/// - The child tries many approaches (64 sectors)
/// - The teacher says "this is better, this is worse"
/// - The child internalizes the better patterns
/// - Next attempt is improved because the internal model shifted
/// - Repeat until the composition is good
///
/// In Phiano, "internalizing" = Kuramoto phase relaxation on the
/// winning texts. The facet literally re-tunes itself.
