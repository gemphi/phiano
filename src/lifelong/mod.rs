#![allow(dead_code, unused_imports)]
//! Lifelong learning coordinator: component reuse, meta-learning, and benchmark tracking.
//!
//! Implements François Chollet's vision of lifelong learning (Ch 14.5):
//! accumulating reusable abstractions and programs across sequential tasks,
//! adapting rapidly via meta-learned phase priors, and monitoring distribution drift.
//! All operations are encapsulated in [`LifelongLearner`], following the Diem
//! convention that all public symbols belong to named types.
//!
//! # Architecture

//! ```text
